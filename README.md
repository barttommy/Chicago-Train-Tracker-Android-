# Chicago Train Tracker

An Android application that tracks incoming Chicago trains!

Extracting and cleaning up my work from a recent hackathon ([check it out here!](https://github.com/agranados0121/DemonHacks))

These are the features I implemented previously that I want to clean up and improve:
* Real time train tracking based on user location
* Real time train location marks on google maps
