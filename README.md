# Doors Closing: A Chicago Train Tracker

*Version 1.0.0 now available on the [Google Play Store!](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tommybart.chicagotraintracker&hl=en_US)*

The Doors Closing app makes tracking incoming CTA trains easier than ever.

Trains near your location are monitored and displayed to provide you with the most relevant data. Whether you are walking to the station or getting ready to transfer, this feature will allow you to plan your time effectively.

Doors Closing works with each of Chicago's 145 CTA train stations. The search feature offers an intuitive and visually appealing way to access the train times for any of these stations manually.

The project began when I continued my work from DemonHacks 2019 ([check out what me and my team made here!](https://github.com/agranados0121/DemonHacks))
